Streamers are functions that take two arguments: a file, and a callback function.

The streamer parses the file, and calls the callback function with each object read from the file.
(For instance, the callback is called for each row in a CSV file).

The streaming returns a Q-like Promise.
It resolves when the file has finished parsing and the callback has been called for everything in the file. 
The promise is rejected on any errors reading when parsing.

Streamers should make a best effort to indeed stream everything, as the files being parsed may be quite large.
